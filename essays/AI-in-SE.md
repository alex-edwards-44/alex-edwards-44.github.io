# AI in ICS 314:

## I. Introduction: AI in Education and Software Engineering

Artificial Intelligence is playing an increasingly vital role in education, particularly in fields that require problem-solving, logic, and coding—like Software Engineering. In the context of ICS 314, AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot offered support in understanding new concepts, debugging code, and enhancing productivity. Throughout the semester, I engaged with all three of these tools in various ways, tailoring their usage to fit the task and my learning goals.

The integration of AI into the software engineering curriculum reflects broader technological trends in the industry. As companies increasingly adopt AI pair-programming tools and large language models for code generation and problem-solving, students benefit from early exposure to these technologies. ICS 314 provided a structured environment to experiment with these tools while developing critical thinking about their appropriate use.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

### 1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)

I typically avoided using AI during Experience WODs because I valued the opportunity to struggle and learn from my own mistakes. If I failed the WOD on the first try (DNF), I sometimes used AI for the second attempt, especially when time was limited. I enjoyed using AI instead of the screencasts because it was much easier for me to ask follow-up questions.

For example, after a DNF on E27 (Five Problems 2), I used ChatGPT on my second attempt and finished it in 17 minutes. The AI helped me move quickly while still reinforcing the material. What I found particularly valuable was how these tools adapted to my specific knowledge gaps.

### 2. In-Class Practice WODs

During these sessions, I rarely used AI. I preferred to rely on my own problem solving skills and collaborate with classmates to reach the solution. The group dynamic and hands on problem solving made AI feel unnecessary in this context.

The collaborative environment during practice WODs offered something AI couldn't replicate including the social aspects of problem-solving. We often arrived at more creative solutions through group work than when using AI individually.

### 3. In-Class WODs

I tried to work through as much of the in class WODs as possible without AI. However, given the time constraints, I often used AI for specific tasks, like generating simple HTML or React component formatting when instructions were clearly provided.

### 4. Essays

When writing essays, I generally drafted my own outline and content first. I then used ChatGPT to improve the flow, polish the language, and strengthen my arguments. It acted as a writing assistant rather than a replacement.

This mirrored professional editing workflows, maintaining ownership while enhancing clarity. Occasionally disagreeing with suggestions helped strengthen my writing identity and style.

### 5. Final Project

I avoided using AI to write actual code during the final project to maintain consistency with collaborators. However, I found AI extremely helpful for generating mockup ideas and brainstorming UI layouts.

### 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial

When course materials didn’t fully clarify a topic, I turned to AI tools. I preferred asking AI quick follow up questions instead of rewatching screencasts. The ability to request multiple explanations of the same concept at different levels of complexity made it more effective than static resources.

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or on Discord

I refrained from using AI to answer classmates' questions due to potential inaccuracies. When I did use AI, it was only to check my own understanding. I always reformulated explanations in my own words.

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question

Same as above, I avoided letting AI generate the content but used it to cross-check or build confidence before responding.

### 9. Coding Example

I often used AI tools to scaffold React components with Bootstrap. For example:  
**"Create a responsive card component in React Bootstrap that displays a user’s profile image, name, and a short bio."**  
This was particularly useful during mockup prototyping.

### 10. Explaining Code

When I didn't understand a snippet, I asked AI to explain it—especially with complex logic like `map`/`filter` combos. These explanations helped me recognize broader programming paradigms.

### 11. Writing Code

While I didn't use AI to write final solutions, I sometimes asked it for quick prototypes or alternate approaches (e.g., Sets vs. filter for removing duplicates). This helped me evaluate trade offs before coding.

### 12. Documenting Code

AI was helpful for generating JSDoc comments or Markdown summaries. Prompts like  
**"Add inline comments to this function for clarity"**  
saved time and improved clarity.

### 13. Quality Assurance (e.g., ESLint Errors)

AI helped diagnose and correct errors efficiently. I would paste snippets and ask,  
**"Fix the ESLint errors in this code."**  
The explanations taught me best practices and increased my understanding of maintainable code.

### 14. Other Uses

I occasionally used ChatGPT for productivity advice, time management, and motivation. These made the broader student experience more manageable.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Overall, AI tools accelerated my learning. They served as tutors, code assistants, and editors. Initially, I over relied on them, but over time, I learned how to balance their use with critical thinking and independent effort.

## IV. Practical Applications

Although I haven’t yet participated in hackathons, I used AI in personal software projects—for debugging, UI planning, and prototyping. These mirrored real world workflows and highlighted AI’s ability to speed up repetitive or time consuming tasks.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

AI tools can hallucinate or suggest subpar code. The challenge is knowing when to trust them. I developed habits for verifying AI outputs by checking docs, testing code, and staying skeptical. These habits strengthened my overall discipline and thinking.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Compared to traditional learning, AI offers faster, more personalized feedback. Traditional methods, like group work and screencasts, help with retention and collaboration. The best outcomes came from blending both AI for speed, traditional for depth.

## VII. Future Considerations

As AI becomes a default tool in education, curriculum design should emphasize higher-order thinking. We must teach students how to evaluate and build on AI outputs, not just consume them. The future of software engineering education lies in balance.

## VIII. Conclusion

AI tools significantly shaped my ICS 314 experience. They weren’t a crutch, but a companion—speeding up workflows, explaining concepts, and improving writing. The key takeaway wasn’t just how to use AI, but when to use it, and how to think critically about its output.
