*Exploring My Interests*

Software engineering is an ever-evolving field that combines creativity, logic, and problem-solving to build to form a real world impact. When I first began my CS journey, I didn't know how much more complex it could be than just coding. My interests stem from the never ending possibilities within computers as well as the ability to design and create my own applications. Among the many areas within software engineering, I am particularly fascinated by artificial intelligence (AI), computer-human interfaces, and the field of software engineering as a whole.


## Artifical Intelligence

The ability of AI to mimic human intelligence makes its potential feel limitless. Since the first models of large language models (LLMs) were released, I have been captivated by their capabilities and eager to learn more. AI is poised to transform countless industries, and I am determined to be part of that transformation. I am excited to dive deeper into this field, learning how to design and implement AI-driven systems that solve complex problems efficiently. Whether it’s developing predictive models, automating tasks, or creating smarter applications, AI represents a domain where innovation and engineering intersect in powerful ways.


## Athletic Software Engineering

One technique that I have started to use to learn TypeScript is athletic software engineering. For those unfamiliar, Athletic Software Engineering emphasizes speed, efficiency, and urgency in software development. Transforming learning into a fast-paced and competitive environment has significantly boosted my motivation and made my learning process more effective. Setting a timer and completing a WOD (Workout of the Day) at home may not perfectly replicate real-world stress, but I quickly noticed improvements in my problem-solving speed and my ability to learn the language. These results were both tangible and rewarding, enhancing the overall efficiency of my learning experience. Athletic Software Engineering and WODs will remain a key part of my growth and progression as a software engineer.

## Excited for the Future


As I approach my final semesters as a university student, I feel both excitement and apprehension about what lies ahead. I am eager to continue building my technical skills, expanding my personal portfolio, and developing social skills through collaboration and team-based projects. At this stage in my journey, I’m still learning something new every day, which makes it difficult to imagine settling into a single niche within the vast field of software engineering. However, this also brings a sense of pressure, as today’s job market often values specialization and extensive experience in a particular area. Despite these challenges, I am committed to contributing to a future where technology not only solves problems but also enhances the way we live and connect. I am looking forward to earning my degree, continuing to diversify my knowledge in programming languages and strengthen my concepts of software engineering
