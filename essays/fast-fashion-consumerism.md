*Unraveling the Social and Environmental Impacts of Fast Fashion and Consumerism*

## Introduction

Fast fashion and consumerism have become pervasive forces shaping the fabric of modern society, and their impacts extend far beyond mere shopping habits. This essay attempts to explore the multifaceted sociological issues arising from the intricate combination of fast fashion and consumerism. Fast fashion, characterized by its rapid production of low-cost, trendy clothing, has revolutionized the fashion industry over the past few decades. The shift towards fast fashion gained momentum in the 1990s, driven by factors such as globalization, advances in technology, and changes in consumer preferences. By taking a deeper look into the historical evolution and complexities of these phenomena, we can gain a vast understanding of the social issues and environmental destruction that have arisen as a result of our pursuit of material possessions. Over the years retailers of all sorts, in attempts to keep up with the trends and affordability, have shortened production cycles of most of their products leading to a never-ending cycle of new fashion. 


## Significance of the Project 

In this consumerist way of life, the emphasis shifted from producing durable, long-lasting clothes to fostering a disposable culture, where fashion items are worn only a few times before being discarded in favor of the next trend. At its core, the relentless pursuit of fashion trends and consumerism projects strong messages about who we are and how we wish to be perceived in a world where appearance/material acquisitions have merged with our sense of self-worth and social status. Today we have things such as second-hand or thrift stores trying to combat these things in order to improve environmental sustainability along with many other reasons.. As we seek to comprehend the ramifications of this new paradigm of disposable fashion with rampant consumerism, it becomes increasingly evident that our actions have far-reaching consequences extending beyond the seemingly innocent act of updating one's wardrobe. 


## Micro 

The significance of addressing the social and environmental issues related to fast fashion and consumerism on a micro level, particularly in a community like Placerville, cannot be overstated. Studying in a smaller town such as Placerville allows you to see the direct and immediate consequences of consumption habits while recognizing the potential for meaningful change and positive impacts. Being a smaller town, it is likely that the community is much more connected, and dissembling information can be easier as well as giving it a more collective effort feeling. By encouraging the growth of sustainable fashion businesses and supporting ethically-produced clothing, the community can promote a sustainable lifestyle with it’s economy, hopefully expiring neighborhood communities. One of the highlights of our small town is the nature, including wildlife and rivers, that I have first hand seen get progressively polluted as I’ve grown up. Lastly, the significance of addressing fast fashion and consumerism on a micro level is in fostering a sense of agency and empowerment among Placerville's residents. Often, individuals may feel overwhelmed by the scale of global issues like climate change and worker exploitation. However, by focusing on our own communities, residents can recognize the power of collective action in effecting meaningful change.


## Meso

When looking at fast fashion from a meso perspective northern California alone holds almost 15 million people. Each year about  “80 pounds per American” (Bick et al. 2018) in garments end up in a landfill. That means over 1 billion lbs of clothes ended up in a landfill in northern California alone which most of could have been reused or thrifted. Fast fashion retailers are making nearly 2 times the amount of product per day and it is because we are consuming it.  The region's diverse fashion-forward population definitely contributes to the demand for these affordable and trendy clothes. The presence of well-known fashion retailers throughout the area appeases many subcultures making it a competitive market. In recent years northern California has definitely made improvements when it comes to searching out eco-friendly brands and second-hand stores but there is still a long way to go. 

## Macro  

At the macro level, we must delve in to the broader implications of fast fashion including its global economic systems and its sustainability. Fast fashion operates in a global capitalist economic system. The industry’s reliance on developing countries raises many concerns alone but it’s obvious these multinational corporations prioritize profits over workers rights, sustainability, and the social inequalities present. At the global level environmental degradation is a huge concern in areas such as pollution and resource depletion. Globalization is a big catalyst for fast fashion as well contributing to the homogenization of cultures. The presence of these global fashion brands and trends can quickly destroy local cultural identities and textile industries unknowingly contributing to a less sustainable earth. 

## Literature Review
Literature Review
The materialist way of life most people live is simply not sustainable for themselves or the environment. The information is present to the public yet so many people don’t care to make a change. This could be because of many reasons including consumer disconnect or some sort of “ethnocentrism” (Schaefer 2021:38) and believing our norms are superior to anyone else's. No matter the causes, it is essential we begin to transition back into a “slow fashion” society. Fast fashion has caused the industry to be considered the second biggest polluting industry behind oil extraction (Diabat et al., 2014, p. 1713). This industry is responsible for excessive water use/pollution, processing of fossil fuels, use of hazardous chemicals, along with extensive greenhouse emissions. We will now look at fast fashion from three different sociological perspectives to help us conceptualize how and why things are like this today. 
Sociology Analysis: Three Perspectives

## Conflict Theory 
From a conflict theorist perspective, the whole fast fashion industry is manifesting its own social problems at every step. The goal of the retailers is to maximize profits and the best way to do this is by buying from the cheapest supplier. This is what makes the fast fashion industry perfect for countries like the US to  “shift the environmental and occupational burdens associated with mass production and disposal from high income countries to the under-resourced (e.g. low income, low-wage workers, women) communities in LMICs” (Bick, Halsey & Ekenga:2018). LMCIs or low and middle-income countries make perfect places for these retailers due to the cheap labor exploitation and lack of environmental laws. Fast fashion is a key perpetrator in many class struggles and inequality. The industry thrives off mass production and low cost labor allowing affluent elites to continue to capitalize.  Besides labor exploitation, the environmental effects caused by this industry starting with the chemicals used to grow the fibers is alarming. Many of the chemicals used on these crops are extremely bad for the environment along with the factory workers. The industry alone produces roughly “92 million tonnes of waste produced per year and 79 trillion litres of water consumed”(Peters et al. 2020). These “dysfunctions” do not end in the countries in which these are manufactured though. Of the many problems it promotes, one most commonly viewed is the promotion of  “consumer culture” (Shaefer 2021:63). These unrealistic expectations often end up hurting lower classes not just financially but emotionally. 

## Interactionalist Theory 
Clothing is something that many people use to symbolize and represent themselves. Clothing serves as a way for us to express ourselves and interpret others. Through an interactionist view, it is most important to look at the interactions between the consumers and the fashion industry. Though things like advertisements are still common the industry has developed new ways to get their products into the hands of the public through different shared meanings and symbols such as “influencers” (Schafer 2021:64). These public figures that are idolized are promoting massive fashion subcultures. These subcultures create a place where people can interact with like-minded people enhancing a sense of belonging and community. 

## Functionalist Theory
From a functionalist perspective, fast fashion emerges as a response to providing affordable, trendy clothing to consumers. The retailers are simply trying to maximize their profits while still maintaining affordability to the average consumer. As society evolves and becomes more intertwined, fashion becomes an even bigger way to express ourselves or conform to social norms. The fast fashion industry also plays a driving role in the economic sector. By making these low-cost goods they are creating a thriving market with high profits. This economic activity creates even more job opportunities in various sectors. They see it as simply another “global commodity chain” (Lee 2017) benefiting all parties involved. This rapid pace in the fashion industry is only encouraging innovation and creativity in the business. They also view how fast fashion reinforces “social stratification” (Schafer 2021: 77) and perpetuates these social hierarchies. Fashion items and brands can stand as status or luxury. Fast fashion affordability allows a wide range of consumers to participate in fashion trends. High-end luxury items still represent elite status. Consequently, the possession of specific fashion items can represent social status reinforcing social division. 


## Research Questions
The following questions are guiding my comparative analysis:

 What are the different ways fast fashion is contributing to environmental pollution?
 
What are the social and cultural factors that influence individual’s adoption of fast fashion and consumerist behaviors?

 What role does education and awareness play in encouraging consumers in Northern California to adopt more sustainable fashion practices, and what are the most effective approaches for promoting such awareness?

 
## Methodology
I am primarily conducting an ethnographic research method, due to the observations, personal interviews, and my volunteer experience. The CSL organization I will be volunteering and conducting research at is Snowline Hospice. Snowline Hospice has been a nonprofit organization since 1979 originally supplying life-ending care to families with chronic illnesses offering a range of services. Snowline puts on a wide range of resources and programs for families in need. As a way to fund this medicare to people in need, along with fighting for sustainability, Snowline Hospice opened multiple thrift stores and recycling centers that also provide care not always provided by other medicare or insurance.  I will likely spend all of my volunteering time at the thrift store doing a wide range of activities. I will most likely spend most of my time taking in donations from the community and cleaning and processing the items for sale.     
Snowline Hospice is a relatively local organization, serving only El Dorado and Sacramento Counties so community is definitely a big aspect of this organization. They have a legacy of volunteerism and that is a majority of their workers. I plan on interviewing the manager of my local thrift store location as well as one of the board of directors to try and get a more inside view of the problems they are combatting in our counties today.  


## Hypothesis 
Based on the body of literature presented today alongside the multi-level sociological analysis presented in this proposal today, it is clear that fast fashion is continuing to grow while being the cause of so many social issues including labor rights, consumerism/materialism, environmental degradation and so many more. I believe that these big retailers alongside influencers and marketing agencies are the reason for the lack of education and continued growth of each of these social issues. If awareness and education around fast fashion is increased within local communities, then we will observe a positive shift towards sustainability and mindful consumer habits.
