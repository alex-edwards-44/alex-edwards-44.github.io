# Project Effort Estimation and Tracking Reflection

## Estimating Effort Based on Experience

When approaching effort estimation for my project, I relied primarily on my best guess informed by past experiences with similar tasks. By recalling how long certain features or bugs had taken in previous projects, I established a baseline for estimating new issues. For example, if implementing a login form had taken approximately 4 hours previously, I'd use that as a starting point, adjusting for any additional complexity or simplifications in the current implementation.

## Value of Making Estimates

Despite the fact that these estimates were often inaccurate, sometimes significantly over or under, I found considerable value in making them. The estimation process forced me to think through the scope and complexity of each issue before diving in. This preliminary planning helped me break down tasks and prioritize more effectively, even when the timing predictions were off. Having these estimates also improved our sprint planning and workload management, allowing us to gauge how much work could reasonably fit into a development cycle and preventing us from overcommitting.

## Benefits of Tracking Actual Effort

Tracking the actual effort expended proved beneficial in several ways. It facilitated better task delegation within the team by identifying which tasks were consuming disproportionate amounts of time, allowing us to reassign them accordingly. Importantly, I didn't experience any significant downsides—the estimation and tracking process didn't create unnecessary pressure or reduce productivity.

The tracked data yielded valuable insights into our development process. By comparing estimates to actual time spent, we gradually improved our estimation accuracy and identified patterns in our work. Certain types of tasks consistently took longer than expected, while others were routinely overestimated. This tracking increased transparency across the team; when someone struggled with a task taking significantly longer than estimated, it was viewed as a data point indicating unexpected complexity rather than a personal failure. From a project management perspective, the effort data provided concrete information to refine future project timelines and resource allocation.

## Tools and Methods for Tracking

For tracking my actual effort, I employed both a stopwatch and the WakaTime plugin. This combination created a comprehensive picture of my work—the stopwatch captured time spent in meetings, researching solutions, or thinking through problems away from the keyboard, while WakaTime automatically logged active coding time with detailed analytics. This dual approach compensated for the limitations of each method and provided a reasonably complete picture of effort expended. I estimate our tracking captured approximately 85-90% of the actual effort, with some brief activities inevitably falling through the cracks.

## Low Overhead and Success of the System

The overhead involved in tracking effort was minimal. Initial setup of WakaTime took less than 10 minutes, after which it ran silently in the background. Manual tracking with the stopwatch became a natural habit—starting at the beginning of a task and stopping when switching contexts. The low-friction nature of this tracking system was crucial to its success, striking the right balance between gathering useful data and maintaining productivity.
