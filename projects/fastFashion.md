Over the summer of 2023, I enrolled in a sociology class where we were tasked to perform a CSL (Community Service Learning) project. In my hometown in Northern California, we have multiple giant thrift stores that are mostly run by volunteer efforts from the community. I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to partake and gain firsthand experience in addressing a small part of the fast fashion problem. 

Studying in a smaller town like mine allows you to see the direct and immediate consequences of consumerist habits while recognizing the potential for meaningful change and positive impacts. For this project, I spent many hours volunteering at the thrift store, helping in all aspects it had to offer. The experiences I had here still influence my mindset, especially pertaining to consumerism and fashion.

In this project, I analyzed the fast fashion issue from micro, meso, and macro levels while relating my findings to theoretical frameworks and sociological theorists.
