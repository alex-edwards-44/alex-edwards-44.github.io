Over the summer of 2023, I enrolled in a sociology class where we were conducted to perform a CSL(community service learning) project. In my hometown in Northern California, we have multiple giant thriftstores that are mostly ran by volunteer efforts from the community. I thought this would be a perfect opprutunity to partake and as well get first hand experience in a small part of the fast 
fashion problem. Studying in a smaller town such as mine allows you to see the direct and immediate consequences of consumerist habits while recognizing the potential for meaningful change and positive impacts.

For this project, I spent many hours volunteering at the thrift store helping in all aspects there was to offer. The experiences I had here still influence my mindset especially partaining to consumerism and fashion. In this project I undergo a micro, meso and macro level of analyis while relating my findings to other theoretical frameworks and socialogical theorists.
